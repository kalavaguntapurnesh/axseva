                      provide. It does not constitute legal, financial, or
                      professional advice unless explicitly stated. To ensure
                      the best possible outcome, you agree to provide accurate,
                      complete, and current information. The quality of the

                      basis, and no guarantees or warranties regarding specific
                      outcomes or results are provided. If applicable, fees for

                      To reschedule or cancel a session, requests must be
                      submitted at least 24 hours in advance. Late cancellations
                      or missed appointments will result in forfeiture of fees.
